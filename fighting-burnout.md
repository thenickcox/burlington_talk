Notes for RubyConf talk

	Slide 1: [e
	Story about adopting Vim because of `[e` keystroke to switch lines. How much time did that save, and how often did I use it? It saved little time, and I lost sight of perspective. It's not editor shortcuts that help, but self care.
	Slide 2:
	Thesis: Focusing on productivity, as measured by editor shortcuts, gems that speed up dest or development environment loading (Spork, Zeus, etc.), remapping keys, and the like, is shortsighted at best, counterproductive at worst. Greater overall improvements in efficiency are gained through sleep and meditation.
	Slide 3:
	"So…you do a lot of typing?
	Besides typing, what do we do as developers.
	Requisite skills for programming:
		Abstract reasoning
		Planning
		Problem-solving

	Slide 3: Let's talk about the brain.
	When I think about programming, I assume it involves so much of the brain. Thought, memory, emotion, reading, etc. Let's talk about one aspect in particular: Talk about prefrontal cortex
		I. Show slide of location
				a. brain accounts for 2% of body weight, but consumes 20-25% of our calories. Correspondingly, the prefrontal cortex consumes about 25% of the glycogen stores of the brain.
		II. Talk about its responsibilities.
				a. Abstractly, prefrontal cortex said to be responsible for "executive function." What is that, exactly?
				b. Umbrella term for a number of cognitive abilities, from organizing and planning to goal setting, problem-solving, abstract thinking (Jackson, M. & Van Dongen, H., 2011, p. 75). Venn diagram

I. Sleep: Intro
	A. Wife works with kids, think like kids. Work with animals, think like animals. Work with computers, think like computers. But computers aren't human, and we put them through a lot (uptime screenshot). It's time to work towards embracing our limitations and our humanity. Uptime screenshot segues to sleeping.
III. Sleeping: 
Two types of sleep: REM & NREM. During REM sleep, brain is aroused. NREM is deep, restorative sleep. Restores glycogen 
stores that power the brain.	
"Sleep…[involves] the restoration of brain energy metabolism through the replenishment of brain glycogen stores that are depleted during wakefulness…[The prefrontal cortex] plays a prominent role in waking executive functions which are preferentially impaired following sleep deprivation" (Nofzinger, E., 2013, p. 203). Executive function. These tasks are impaired following sleep deprivation, and restored after "recovery sleep." Tasks involving executive function are adversely affected by, and thus especially vulnerable to, sleepiness (Jackson, M. & Van Dongen, H., 2011, p. 75).

III. Guided meditation: Thesis: Stress affects our ability to do our jobs sustainably and leads to burnout. Then, what good has efficiency served?
	I. Stress: Thesis: Our jobs are stressful.
	Perspective. Average developer salary is twice the median household income. Developers tend to be educated and have access to further knowledge. Encourage us to see our privilege, but to acknowledge that most companies tend to neglect our human needs, working 60+ hour weeks, building quick launches, etc. Are we eating well? Sleeping well? 
	Stressful story about making an assertion of current user when there wasn't one, which meant over 50% of visitors were getting an error page. Deployment time nearly 6 minutes. What did I do during that time? Stress out. I work for a cancer site, and deploying code successfully seemed like a matter of life and death. But it wasn't. What do I wish I did? Relax, meditate.
	What happens in the brain with stress? Cortisol is released, and parts of the brain are stimulated, among them the prefrontal cortex (as it involves the planning, and in this case is designed to plan the physical response to the stressor). Over time, stress leads to decreased blood flow to the prefrontal cortex. Like the town to the boy who cried wolf, it stops responding (Bremner, 2002, p. 134).
	As a developer, I wanted to meditate, but was impatient. Wanted to take the Jack Donaghy approach (meditate perfectly). I think there's a way to get some of the benefits of meditating without having to sit in a chair for 10 minutes every morning.
	Stand up. Find your diaphragm. Diaphragm works opposite of lungs. When it contracts, it allows lungs to expand.
4 fingers under where chest starts.	

Focus on breathing. Not 5 minutes, but practicing taking one breath at a time. Then three breaths. Then ten breaths. How can we have micromeditations? Times to meditate:
1. Unit tests - one breath.
2. Integration Tests – three breaths.
3. Deploys: 5-10 breaths.

Adrenaline reabsorption
	

IV. Conclusion
	It is counterproductive to spend time dialing in our .vimrc files and finding shortcuts that save us fractions of seconds per minute while neglecting our sleeping, eating, and relaxation  habits.
	Slide: Be kind to yourself.
